### Live Demo

### Scenario:

Microsoft used to own the world with their sophisticated IDE, Microsoft Visual Studio. It’s built-in
tools and integrations enhanced developer productivity to such an extent Windows-based software
products flourished and grew extensively. However, like all projects, grew into a state of
burdensome complexity and has now become a tool too unwieldy for novice programmers. They
tried to address this with their lighter-weight Express series of IDEs but there was just too much
institutional momentum to produce a light-weight product that could be useful while not being
intimidating to new developers. Satya Nadella, the new CEO of Microsoft has launched a secret
project to develop a modern, lightweight, IDE that mimics of jEdit (http://www.jedit.org), a popular
open-source editor. The project is codenamed “Not jEdit” or “njEdit” for short.

Microsoft’s standard test plan is to conduct tests in three phases; unit/integration test phase, system
test phase, and acceptance test phase. The development team brings their own testing strategy for
their phase of the effort. Their approach is to use unit tests, nightly smoke tests, and point release
regression tests in a continuous integration environment, see addendum for details. Microsoft also
has a dedicated group for acceptance testing prior to release. Your team has been selected to a)
advise and comment on the developer team’s strategy, and b) draft a phase level test plan for the
system test phase.

Facing serious threats from other operating systems and platforms, Satya is staking Microsoft’s
future on re-energizing the Windows developer community (“DEVELOPERS! DEVELOPERS!
DEVELOPERS!”). Satya plans on releasing this project along side Windows 10. Satya lists the three
most important characteristics of this new IDE as the following; it doesn’t crash, it is simple to use,
and that it looks like an Office application.
